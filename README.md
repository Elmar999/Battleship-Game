BattleShip project -- NIHAD SHUKUR and ELMAR HAJIZADE

This project simulates the games between player and bot , on the other hand the game between 2 players using network 
programming distributed in this program . First we started from Bot version with agile development , our bot will randomly 
shoot the player cell but not the cell that already hitten by the bot . Morever , we have two panels one for placing the ships 
another is for getting the shoot from the bot . We have a constructor Battletest() which does everything that is needed to do. 
For multiplayer game we have server-client connection . We looked one player as a server and another as a client . When two 
players push the confirm button server-client connection establishes . More information can be seen in uml diagrams .

For launching the program :
  welcome_page_bot.java used for launching the game with bot;
 welcome_page_user1.java used for launching the player1;
 welcome_page_bot.java used for launching the player2.
